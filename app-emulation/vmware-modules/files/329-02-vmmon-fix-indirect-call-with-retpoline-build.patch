Subject: [PATCH 09/10] vmmon: fix indirect call with retpoline build

Build against kernel with retpoline support issues warning

  objtool: Task_Switch()+0x425: indirect call found in RETPOLINE build

This is because an indirect call in TaskSwitchToMonitor() is encoded using
inline assembler so that it bypasses retpoline generation. For this
purpose, macro CALL_NOSPEC exists since v4.15-rc8 (and has been backported
into some distribution kernels with the rest of retpoline support). Use the
macro if available and fallback to the original code if not.
